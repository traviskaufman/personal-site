            While at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refinery29.com">Refinery29</a>, I worked with a small core

            build their first-ever website specifically for mobile browsers. I rearchitected the entire app using
            BackboneJS and
            Browserify. The mobile site was used by millions of people, and much of the frontend infrastructure was
            adopted throughout the entire codebase. I also had the pleasure of engaging with
